    "description": "Careers Human Data - San Francisco About the Team OpenAI is dedicated to ensuring that our AI systems are safe, trustworthy, useful, and consistently aligned with human values, even as they scale in complexity and capability. Our research focuses on methods that help AI reliably follow human intent in diverse scenarios\u2014including adversarial or high-stakes settings\u2014and ultimately maximize its benefit to individuals and society. A critical component of our approach involves leveraging high-quality human and synthetic data to train and evaluate models, ensuring alignment techniques remain effective as capabilities grow. We work with experts across domains and modalities to develop scalable methods for generating high-quality data, and using it to produce safe and useful models. The two pillars of our approach are: (1) harnessing improved capabilities into alignment, making sure that our alignment techniques improve, rather than break, as capabilities grow, and (2) centering humans by developing mechanisms and interfaces that enable humans to both express their intent and to effectively supervise and control AIs, even in highly complex situations. We're looking for individuals with strong ML engineering skills, research experience, and a deep understanding of Human-Machine Interaction challenges, especially with novel and highly capable models. About the Role As a Research Engineer, you will: Research and model mechanisms that create value for people, with an emphasis on explaining or predicting preferences, behaviors, and satisfaction. Quantify the nuances of human behavior and capture them in data-driven systems, whether by designing advanced labeling tasks or analyzing user feedback patterns Design robust evaluations for measuring alignment and real-world utility, iterating quickly to uncover what makes certain feedback and training protocols more effective. Design and evaluate new Human-AI-interaction paradigms and scalable oversight methods that redefine how humans interact with, understand, and supervise our models. Develop and evaluate alignment capabilities that are subjective, context-dependent, and hard to measure. You might thrive in this role if you: Have experience with machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) and are comfortable experimenting with large-scale models. Enjoy moving fluidly between high-level research questions and low-level implementation details, adapting methods to solve ambiguous, dynamic problems. Are goal-oriented instead of method-oriented, and are not afraid of tedious but high-value work when needed. Have an interest or background in cognitive science, computational linguistics, human-computer interaction, or social sciences. Are strongly motivated by OpenAI\u2019s mission of building safe, universally beneficial AGI and are aligned with OpenAI\u2019s charter Want to work on systems that balance breakthrough capabilities with robust alignment, ultimately shaping a safer and more human-centered AI landscape.

We are building an AI powered knowledge system that evolves and learns as our products, systems and customers evolve. We leverage our state of the art models, technologies, and products (some external, some still in the lab) to assist or completely automate robust operations supporting both internal and external customers. We support OpenAI customers and internal partners globally, powering systems from customer support to integrity to product insights. We are a self-contained multi-disciplinary team, who enjoy a lightning fast feedback loop with customers at scale, some of whom sit just a few pods away. We iterate fast, and engineer for reliable long-term impact. We're constantly looking for the similarities and patterns in different types of work, and focus on building simple primitives, to apply world class knowledge to many domains. The work of this team exemplifies use of OpenAI technologies. We build systems so everyone can see the leverage that is possible with well designed AI-based implementations. We do this by working through internal use cases focused on Customers (specifically knowledge systems, automation systems, and automated agent systems) to prove impact, then we scale. About the Role We\u2019re looking for Full Stack Engineers who're passionate about blending production-ready platform architecture with new tech and new paradigms.
